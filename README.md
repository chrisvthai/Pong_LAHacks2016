1. Introduction
Created at my first hackathon ever, LA Hacks 2016. For some reason, I had trouble transferring the entire project folder into GitHub, so I moved just the important bits (assets like scripts, executable, readme).

Multiple balls at a time. Whenever a ball hits a goal, the frame restarts. This is a bit buggy as of now.

2. Controls
WASD: Player 1 Paddle movement
